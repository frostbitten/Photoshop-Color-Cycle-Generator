# Photoshop Color Cycle Generator

This tool helps in the design of color cycle animations by doing a few things:
* Precomputing the value offset for each frame using custom Gradient Maps
* Automatically creates the necessary frames and animates the appropriate layers
* Prepares both forward and reverse sets of animation frames

*Enjoy fast prototyping and designing of your own color cycle animations!*

**Instructions:**
1. Run the script. A window will pop up asking how many frames the animation should run for. 24 is a good default.
2. Once complete, you will find two new groups, one for forward and one for backwards animation. Use whichever you prefer for your artwork.
3. Add a new Gradient Map adjustment layer to the very top of the layer stack. Here you can freely modify the color cycle without worrying about updating each frame.
